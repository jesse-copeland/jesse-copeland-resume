      <p>
        I am a full-stack JavaScript developer looking for the opportunity to work with the latest technologies to solve diverse challenges. As a software developer and IT professional, versatility is one of my strongest traits.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a proven history of filling a wide range of roles in a variety of situations by adapting to the challenges at hand, either through applying previous experience or learning new skills needed to be successful. I am an excellent troubleshooter who is driven to find root cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work well within a team, appreciating and understanding interpersonal relationships and the value of consensus building. Outside of work, I maintain connections in the Honolulu tech community.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a self-motivated, continuous learner who is driven by complex challenges. I joined DevLeague to make sure my skill-set aligned with tends occurring within modern web development. After completing DevLeague, I joined them to help strengthen my understanding though teaching others.
