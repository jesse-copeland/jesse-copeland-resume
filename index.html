      I am an experienced programmer looking for the opportunity to work with the latest technologies to solve diverse challenges. As a software developer and IT professional, versatility is one of my strongest traits. I have a proven history of filling a wide range of roles in a variety of situations by adapting to the challenges at hand, either through applying previous experience or learning new skills needed to be successful. I work well within a team, appreciating and understanding interpersonal relationships and the value of consensus building. I am a self-motivated, continuous learner who is driven by complex challenges. Outside of work I maintain connections in the Honolulu tech community. I am a founding member of aloha.rb and an active member of ohana.js.
